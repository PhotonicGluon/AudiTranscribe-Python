Todo:
    - Make clicking on the same row as a note to play that note
        - Animate the notes canvas?
    - Allow playing of audio along with the spectrogram
    - Fully implement "save project"
        - Allow the updated values on the transcription page to change the values in `status.yaml`
    - Allow deleting of projects
    - Fill in the rest of the main page
    - Update `README.md`

Fixme:
    - Validation on the transcription is insufficient
        - E.g. empty fields break everything
    - Fix spectrogram not showing occasionally
    - Beats lines take a long time to update if the spectrogram is long
