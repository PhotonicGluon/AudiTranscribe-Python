Todo:
    - Make clicking on the same row as a note to play that note
        - Animate the notes canvas?
    - Add loading screen whilst the spectrogram is still being loaded
    - Allow playing of audio along with the spectrogram
    - Fill in the rest of the main page
    - Update `README.md`

Fixme:
    - (URGENT) Fix spectrogram not showing occasionally
    - Beats lines take a long time to update if the spectrogram is long
    - Massive lag when switching back to some spectrograms
