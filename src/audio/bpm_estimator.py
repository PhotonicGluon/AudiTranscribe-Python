# FUNCTIONS
def estimate_bpm(samples: np.ndarray, sample_rate: int) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Estimates the beats per minute (BPM) of a audio piece.

    Args:
        samples:
            Audio time series. Can be obtained by using the `wav_to_samples` function.

        sample_rate:
            Sample rate of the audio piece. Can be obtained by using the `wav_to_samples` function.

    Returns:
        bpm:
            Estimated tempo (beats per minute) of the song. If the song is of uniform tempo then this will be a
            one-element array. Otherwise, the different values present represent the different BPM of the song.
