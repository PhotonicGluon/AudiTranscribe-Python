    Converts an audio file into a constant bitrate (CBR) MP3 file for further processing.

    Args:
        audiosegment:
           The `AudioSegment` object.

        filename:
            Filename of the CBR MP3 file.
            This is JUST THE FILE NAME, without the extension of ".mp3".

        bitrate:
            The bitrate of the CBR encoding.
            The value that is entered here is in THOUSANDS. So a value of 128 means a bitrate of 128,000 (i.e. 128k)

    Returns:
        str:
           Path to the MP3 file.
